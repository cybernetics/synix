## This is the development branch for the Contributors

## [Synix](https://synixjs.github.io/): A no-flag nodeJs CLI to make the use of command-line easy and uniform

To link synix globally and test commands use this branch

### Linking to npm
```bash

$ npm link
# In the root

```
By doing this you will have a command `sxd` as a global command to test your code   

`npm unlink` in the same directory will unlink it
